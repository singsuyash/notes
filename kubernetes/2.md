Context directory
- the . specified in `docker build` is the Context directory.
- Contents of Context Directory are copied over to docker engine.
- the contents of your context directory has to be copied over to the docker engine so that when docker build runs on the docker engine,and commands written in dockerfile run,  all that is required to create the image is available on the docker engine.

kubernetes master
- api server - container
    - REST api
    - exposed to the world
    - other master components talk to each other via api server
    - can be many for HA
- etcd
 - distributed, key value store
 - used to store all cluster data
 - the only stateful component in kubernetes
 - Source of truth
 - can be many for HA
- scheduler - container
 - Active only in one master, passive in other masters, come up when the elected active goes down
 - Runs "controllers" in kubernetes
 - Controllers are daemons that ensure the desired state is achieved in the cluster
 - Examples
    - 
- controller-manager - container
 - Active only in one master, passive in other masters, come up when the elected active goes down
 - Assigns a node for newly created pods
 - node controller, replication controller, endpoints controller
 - kind of centralized monitoring + actions. event driven.
 - reconciliation loop

nodes - are actual deployment target machines

Nodes
- kubelet
    - face of your node, this talks to master
    - main agent on the node
    - talks to api server, and api server can also talk to kubelet, its a bi directional
    - instantiates pods
    - reports to master
- container runtime
    - deals with the container abstraction
    - pull images, start/stop containers
    - works with any OCI compliant container engine, eg: docker, rkt
- kube-proxy
    - deals with networking within the node
    - assigns an IP to each "pod"
    - is primarily used to maintain the "service" abstraction
    - this is how containers talk to each other

kubectl
    - `kubectl [command] [TYPE/resource]`
    - kubectl config
        - Cluster
        - Namespace, access control, now at RBAC
        - User
        - Context, like a connection string -> namespace.cluster.user

    
PODs
- deployable units
- a pod can have multiple containers
    - these containers share the same namespace, same filesystem, same network
    - Ring-fenced environments
        - Network stack
        - Volume Mounts
        - Kernel namespace
- Multi-container POD
    - web server
    - log collector, splunk
    - these 2 can go together always
- there is some health check for the pod, if that fails, the pod fails
- pods need to have different ip across whole kubernetes network space
- intra pod via localhost
- `kubectl get pods -o wide`
- `kubectl exec -it pod-demo /bin/bash`, this takes you inside a container, even though you have not specified which container. in case of multi container pod, this command would have failed.
- ssh worker1, curl 10.244.2.80:8080
- pod yaml has multiple environment variables, at a container level
