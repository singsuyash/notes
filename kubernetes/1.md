iaas - hardware
caas - container (vm minus the guest os)
paas - softwares like jvm, node 
saas - application

vm based iaas model
hardware->host os -> hypervisor(Virtualization) -> guest os -> softwares -> apps

guest os cons
- consumes resources
- its large
- security, single tenant/multi tenant, this also involves cost. single tenancy has higher cost
- install and maintain a lot of things
- overhead of os startup

guest os pros
- isolation
- more control

* remove guest os, its containers

container model
hardware -> host os -> container engine (LXC, Linux containers) -> softwares -> apps

LXC (Linux Containers)
- cgroups
- namespace isolation

LXC pros
- envs are sandboxed
- container lifecycle is defined by the main process
- boot time is main process start time
- container can have multiple process other than main process
- vm are more secure than containers
- resource allocation can be dynamically managed using cgroups
    - you can not change your vm ram without shutting it down, but with containers you can modify ram in runtime

Container packaging
- .class
- app.jar, collection of .class
- .war, lib.jar's, app.jar
- .ear, .war
- uber-executable.jar app.jar, lib.jar, server.jar
- container -> uber-executable.jar + jvm, other softwares + LXC


Docker
LXC                         | Docker
tightly coupled with host   | portable
Persistent                  | Ephemeral
Multi App env               | Single Application
No Versioning/Reusability   | Reusable versioned Layers

Docker Architecture
Build - Docker Registry
Pull - images to local cache
Run - create containers

`eval $(minikube docker-env)` --> this connects your client to the minikube VM
- makes minikube your host os. 
- same as a terminal running in your vm

`docker run busybox` starts and exits. so `docker ps` will not show a running container.
- Actually it started and exited.
- logs of main process go to docker logs

TAGS/Versions
- one image goes to multiple tags

`docker pull <image>`
- downloads multiple bytes in parallel, these are layers of the same image

node:latest is 700mb because its base image is ubuntu
node:alpine is 70 mb because the base image is alpine, alpine is a trimmed version of linux
* try to keep your image size small *
- ubuntu image, doesn't contain the full os, it just contains file system and libraries of ubuntu

Images
- every image is made up of layers
- immutable
- snapshot of a container

Docker Image layers
- lot of read-only layers
- top read-write application layer

- Create image from an existing image
- Or a Dockerfile

- run the main process via `ENTRYPOINT` or `CMD`
- every line in the dockerfile is a **layer**

- see layers of an image
    - `docker history <image name>`
- layers are shared between images
- when you pull/move docker images to another machine, only layers which are not available will be downloaded.
- layers are made on SHA
- layers are kept in docker cache
- docker build, internally uses a git kind of behaviour to identify that the file was changed and this time the layer building has to be done fully and not pull from cache.
- once the cache use stops while building, all later layers have to be built. This is because each layer has a link to the parent layer.
- docker has an inbuilt file system AUFS
- docker has a .dockerignore just like .gitignore

- `ps` in the container, the main process will have pid = 1

- delete image, deletes layers also.
- in essence, images can have dependency on other images

Docker image name & Version
k8s.gcr.io/kube-proxy-amd64:v1.10.0
---------- => this part is namespace
          ----------------- => this part is image name (application name)
                           -------- => this part is the tag
