# Stateful Sets
- how to do distributed datastore setup
- service on top of pod=>pvc=>pv=>filesystem
- 3 such services. now do the elastic search setup. by service names (dns name), instead of IP
- another problem is the ordering of machine startups, the master has to come up before slave.
- stateful sets solve this problem

- its a kubernetes object
- `volumeClaimTemplates` - this creates pvc-0, pvc-1, pvc-2 for pod-0, pod-1, pod-2
    - attach this with a storage class

- Create a headless service on top of stateful sets
    - SRV records, CASSANDRA_SEEDS
    - providing a unique identity to each pod
    - clusterIP: None
    - external world will connect via this service
- when you create the stateful sets, the cluster IP is not assigned.
    - you need to connect to your datastore via the SRV records.

- create statefulsets, this creates the database cluseter
- create a service on top of this statefulsets, this service is used by the clients.
    - this service doesn't have a clusterIP
    - clients will connect via the pod dns names
- what happens in case of a master/slave setup. there are name nodes which become the pod dns names
- to connect to cassandra database, you connect with the whole SRV name.


# Configmaps & Secrets

- command line args
- properties file
- environment variables

- config maps are stored in etcd
- objects, create via kubectl create configmap, by passing cmd line arguments, or via a file, or a yaml
- this is used to have environment variables available to the pod.
- configmap can be used as command line args

`kubectl expose pod` -> create a service

## Secrets
- configuration in config maps
- secrets in secrets
- secrets are encrypted, decryption key is with apiserver
- hashicorp vault can interact with databases to create user/passwords, and they stay with the vault. they don't come out.

# Jobs
- object for jobs
- creates one or more pods and enures they terminate
- Job is complete when wll pods successfully terminate
- will keep trying until job is complete
- use case for job is a batch
- example dataload.sh

## Parallel Job

- serverless on top of kubernetes, fission


# DaemonSets
- daemonset pod runs on every node
- daemonset you don't need to specify count, like you do in a replicaset where replica=x
- this is different from the 'sidecar' container that could have been used for logging(eg.), sidecars used to be per pod, here this pod is common for all the pods in the node.
- eg. logging pod gets logs from a hostPath directory, the app pods write to that hostPath

# HELM
- package manager for kubernetes
- templating for applications
- manage and share manifests
- be able to slightly tweak definitions for different environments
- charts: this is whole provisioning for something like (postgres)
- docker base image/ helm chart
- make your custom image/ make your custom chart using a base helm chart
- chart is usually per application
`helm search` - like chef supermarket
`helm install`

## HELM Components
- tiller
- client

# CI & CD
- setup pipeline for app for cd on ci
- setup ci server (build server)
- lets say setup is done, problem is in maintaining agents.
- setup is also time consuming
- run, builds are waiting in queue during heavy load
- adding new agents just for sometime

- Kubernetes managed CI
    - Helm charts for CI setup
    - pods are agents(elastic agents)
    - gocd helm chart is available

# k8s effects
- k8s as a service, gke, aws, azure, digitalocean

## Container Design Principles

### Build time principles
- Single Concern principle
    - every container should address a single concern and do it well
- Self Containment Principle
    - a container should rely only on the presence of the linux kernel and have additional libraries added to it at build time
    - avoids single point of failure
- Image Immutability Principle
    - containerized applications are meant to be immutable, and once built are not changed between different environments

### Runtime design principles
- High Observability principle
    - every container must implement all necessary APIs to help the platform observe and manage the application in the best way possible
        - process health, readiness, liveness
        - metics, tracing, logs
- Lifecycle Conformance Principle
    - a container should have a way to read the events coming from the platform and conform by reacting to those events
        - sigterm, sigkill
        - prestop, poststart
- Process disposability principle
    - containerized applications need to be as ephemeral as possible and ready to be replaced by another container instance at any point in time
- Runtime Confinement Principle
    - every container should declare its resource requirements and it is also important that the application stay confined to the indicated resource requirements

## K8s Design Patterns

### Single pod multi-container patterns
- sidecar pattern
    - a container which enhances the functionality of a pre-existing container without changing it
- Ambassador pattern
    - this pattern hides complexity and provides a unified view of the world to your container
- Adapter pattern
    - an adapter is kind of reverse ambassador and provides a unified interface to a pod from the outside world

### Single container patterns
- Initializer pattern
    - init containers allow separation of initialization related tasks from the main application logic
- Self Awareness pattern
- Leader Election Pattern
- Work Queue Pattern
- Custom Controller Pattern

## best practices
- aim for small images
- support arbitrary user IDs
- mark important ports, port management
- use volumes for persistent data
- set image metadata
- sync host and image, time sync
- log to stdout & stderr
